# ðŸš§ Development Standards

The style of codes follows the rule of [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

The preferred IDE for this project is VSCode. You can also choose other IDE, such as PyCharm, or even Sublime. But I strongly recommend you to try VSCode for its productivity, customizability, few occupied system resources, and fast UI.
